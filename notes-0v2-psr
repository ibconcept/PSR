# PSR v2: A New Model for Evaluating Gig Work Based on Output Metrics

In my time navigating the gig economy—building sites, optimizing interfaces, shipping MVPs—I noticed a clear gap: **how do we fairly reward quality without overpaying or underestimating effort**?

That’s where **PSR v2** comes in.

I call it the **Problem–Solution–Result** (PSR) model. At its heart, it’s a minimal, three-tier framework that focuses on:
- The **problem** (what needs doing),
- The **solution** (what’s delivered),
- And the **result** (how well it performs).

Version 2 takes this further by introducing an **objective checklist**. Whether it’s a landing page, dashboard, mobile app, or even a UX audit—**results should speak louder than buzzwords**.

## Why PSR?

Traditional models like Agile, Kanban, Scrum, Waterfall, or Lean are process-heavy and time-centric. That’s great for long-term product teams. But **gig work** often deals with:
- Known problems,
- Expected outcomes,
- And fast delivery timelines.

**PSR is built for that environment.** No long sprints. No vague reviews. Just a clear path from issue to resolution—and a **measurable way to pay**.

## How PSR Works in Practice

1. **Problem**: Clearly state the task (e.g., “Redesign our product page for conversion”).
2. **Solution**: Deliver the work (UI/UX, code, visuals, etc.).
3. **Result**: Run it through a standardized checklist of 10 performance indicators.

You get scored based on objective benchmarks using tools like PageSpeed Insights, Lighthouse, and Ubersuggest that produce **quantitative scores**. Each metric is rated 1, 2, or 3 based on its percentage or numerical value.

## Evaluation Metrics and Weight Scores

| Metric               | Tool Example                 | Scoring Criteria              | Score  |
|----------------------|------------------------------|-------------------------------|--------|
| Page Speed           | Google PageSpeed             | <50 = 1, 50-79 = 2, 80+ = 3    | 1-3    |
| Accessibility        | Lighthouse                   | <50 = 1, 50-79 = 2, 80+ = 3    | 1-3    |
| SEO Score            | Ubersuggest / Lighthouse     | <50 = 1, 50-79 = 2, 80+ = 3    | 1-3    |
| Mobile Responsiveness| Chrome DevTools Audit        | Poor = 1, Ok = 2, Excellent = 3| 1-3    |
| Code Quality         | ESLint / SonarLint           | Poor = 1, Average = 2, Good = 3| 1-3    |
| Functionality        | Test Coverage Report         | <70% = 1, 70-90% = 2, >90% = 3 | 1-3    |
| Cross-platform       | BrowserStack / Manual        | Few = 1, Some = 2, Many = 3    | 1-3    |
| UX Score             | UX Test Tool / Survey Result | Poor = 1, Ok = 2, Excellent = 3| 1-3    |
| Delivery Timeliness  | Manual                       | Late = 1, On-time = 2, Early = 3| 1-3   |
| Design Consistency   | Figma Review                 | Inconsistent = 1, Ok = 2, Clean = 3|1-3|

## Scoring → Payment Structure

Based on total points earned (max: 30), the gig payout adjusts as follows:

| Score (out of 30) | Payout (USD) |
|-------------------|--------------|
| 10–15             | $20          |
| 16–20             | $35          |
| 21–24             | $60          |
| 25–28             | $80          |
| 29–30             | $100         |

This model promotes **fairness, performance, and transparency**. And for freelancers? It’s empowering—**results bring reward**.

## Why It Matters

In the gig space, time is critical—but **quality should always matter more**. PSR v2 flips the conversation from “How fast did you deliver?” to “**How well did you solve the problem?**”

We no longer need to argue over rates when the **outcome speaks for itself**.

---

## PSR vs Traditional Models

Compared to Scrum, Agile, Lean UX, Waterfall, and others:
- PSR has **less overhead**.
- It’s **output-focused**, not process-dependent.
- It scales better for **short-term work** and **micro-projects**.

## GitHub + Future Tools

The [PSR Model is open-source on GitHub](https://github.com/ibconcept/PSR). Future versions will include a dashboard to input URLs or uploads, tick checkboxes, and auto-score based on online performance tools.
